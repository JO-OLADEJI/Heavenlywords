```
API_URL = "<< your alchemy HTTP key >>"
PRIVATE_KEY = "<< private key of contract deployer >>"
```
- Create an app on [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)(rinkeby network) and copy the HTTP link
- Paste the link as the value of **API_URL** variable in the .env file
- Also paste the private key(of the address that'll deploy the contract) in the .env file
- Run the follwing to compile and deploy the contract:
```javascript
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```
- Copy the contract address displayed on the terminal

### Frontend
- Change directory to client:
```bash
cd ../nft-website
```
- Create a **.env** file in the current directory and add the following:
```
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_URL = ""
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = ""
```
- Fill the variables with their values
- Start the development server:
